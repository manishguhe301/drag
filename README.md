# Drag and Drop

To run and test the solution, you can follow these steps:

Create an HTML file and paste the HTML code provided earlier into it.
Create a CSS file and paste the CSS code provided earlier into it. Make sure to link the CSS file to the HTML file using the link tag.
Create a JavaScript file and paste the optimized JavaScript code with comments into it. Make sure to link the JavaScript file to the HTML file using the script tag.
Open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see two containers with draggable elements in one of them.
Test the drag and drop functionality by dragging elements from one container to the other.
Test the reset functionality by clicking on the reset button.
