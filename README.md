# Drag and Drop

To run and test the solution, you can follow these steps:

- Create an HTML file and paste the HTML code into it.
- Create a CSS file and paste the CSS code into it.
- Create a JavaScript file and paste the JavaScript code into it.
- Open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see two containers with draggable elements in one of them.
- Test the drag and drop functionality by dragging elements from one container to the other.
- Test the reset functionality by clicking on the reset button.
